# Task Description

This particular task will focus on the basics of using Git and GitHub. You will learn and implement how to do the following:

#### (a) Fork a GitHub repository

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

#### (b) Clone a GitHub repository

Cloning is a process of creating an identical copy of a Git Remote Repository to the local machine. When we clone a repository, all the files are downloaded to the local machine but the remote git repository remains unchanged. Making changes and committing them on your local repository (cloned repository) will not affect the remote repository that you cloned in any way. These changes made on the local machine can be synced with the remote repository anytime the user wants.

#### (c) Stage changes in a GitHub repository

A staging step in git allows you to continue making changes to the working directory, and when you decide you wanna interact with version control, it allows you to record changes in small commits.

#### (d) Commit changes in a GitHub repository

Commits are the building blocks of "save points" within Git's version control. By using commits, you're able to craft history intentionally and safely. You can make commits to different branches, and specify exactly what changes you want to include.

#### (e) Push changes to a GitHub repository

As you commit changes to your project locally, you can push those changes to GitHub so that others may access them from the remote repository. When you push changes, you send the committed changes in your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub. If you change your project locally and want other people to have access to the changes, you must push the changes to GitHub.

#### (f) Give Pull requests to a GitHub repository

When you’re ready for feedback, submit a pull request. Pull requests are a feature specific to GitHub. They provide a simple, web-based way to submit your work (often called “patches”) to a project. It’s called a pull request because you’re asking the project to pull changes from your fork.
